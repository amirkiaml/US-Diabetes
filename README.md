# The U.S. Diabetes Dataset -- EDA and Machine Learning

The diabetes data is from U.S. hospitals during the period 1999-2008. It includes approximately 100,000 records with approximately 50 variables.

In this notebook I explore the dataset and determine if there are any sub-groups that are at higher risk for hospital readmission.

The raw data can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This data is publicly available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

A description of the variables found in the dataset can be found here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/781670


Here are different stages of the project and the tasks required to perform:

**Data Cleaning**

- Load and clean the data. Briefly describe the cleaning steps that were needed. Are there any major problems with this data that should be fixed for future analysis? If so, briefly give your recommendations.


**EDA and Statistics**

- Conduct exploratory data analysis and summarize the findings. Among other things, describe and visualize the demographics of the population, provide a breakdown of the admission types (with descriptions), and identify the overall % of patients who were readmitted. Describe any data transformations needed to obtain this overview.

- Identify a few sub-groups to explore and note why you choose these groups. Identify if any of the selected groups are at higher risk for readmission.

- Summarize the main findings in a paragraph or two.

**Machine Learning**

- Create a logistic-regression model, and evaluate its performance. Include appropriate metrics and visual outputs.
